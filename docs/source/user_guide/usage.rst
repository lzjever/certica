Usage
=====

Interactive UI Mode
-------------------

To launch the interactive UI, use the ``ui`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   certica ui

The interactive interface provides a menu-driven interface for all operations.

Command Line Mode
-----------------

All operations can also be performed via the command line. See :doc:`../quickstart` for examples.

Language Support
----------------

The ``--lang`` option is only available in UI mode:

.. code-block:: bash

   certica ui --lang zh  # Chinese

CLI commands always use English for script compatibility.
